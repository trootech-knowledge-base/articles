<ul>
  <li><strong>Declarative UI</strong>: React makes it easy to design interactive UIs with simple component structures.</li>
  <li><strong>Component-Based</strong>: Build encapsulated components that manage their state and compose them to make complex UIs.</li>
  <li><strong>Learn Once, Write Anywhere</strong>: Use React to develop web and mobile applications efficiently.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>React allows you to build encapsulated components that manage their state and update efficiently when data changes.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2 id="core-concepts">Core Concepts</h2>

<h3 id="jsx">JSX</h3>
<p>JSX allows you to write HTML inside JavaScript. Example:</p>

<div class="language-jsx highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nf">Welcome</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">props</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Hello, <span class="si">{</span><span class="nx">props</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="si">}</span>!<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="components-and-props">Components and Props</h3>
<p>React applications are built using components. There are two types:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Functional Components</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Class Components</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Example of a functional component:</p>

<div class="language-jsx highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nf">Greeting</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="nx">name</span> <span class="p">})</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Hello, <span class="si">{</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="si">}</span>!<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="state-and-lifecycle">State and Lifecycle</h3>
<p>State allows components to manage changing data. Example:</p>

<div class="language-jsx highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">import</span> <span class="nx">React</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">useState</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">react</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nf">Counter</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">count</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">setCount</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">useState</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span>

  <span class="k">return </span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
      <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Count: <span class="si">{</span><span class="nx">count</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
      <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">button</span> <span class="na">onClick</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nf">setCount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">count</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Increment<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">button</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="laravel-installation-guide">Laravel Installation Guide</h2>

<p><em>Note: This guide assumes you have basic knowledge of PHP and Composer.</em></p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Before installing Laravel, ensure you have the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>PHP (&gt;= 8.0)</strong> – Laravel requires PHP 8.0 or higher.</li>
  <li><strong>Composer</strong> – Laravel uses Composer to manage dependencies.</li>
  <li><strong>Web Server</strong> – Apache or Nginx.</li>
  <li><strong>Database</strong> – MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or SQL Server.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="installing-laravel">Installing Laravel</h2>

<h3 id="using-composer">Using Composer</h3>

<p>Run the following command in your terminal:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>composer create-project <span class="nt">--prefer-dist</span> laravel/laravel my-laravel-app
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This command installs Laravel in a new directory called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-laravel-app</code>.</p>

<h3 id="verifying-installation">Verifying Installation</h3>

<p>Navigate into your project folder:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd </span>my-laravel-app
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Start the local development server:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>php artisan serve
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Open <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://127.0.0.1:8000</code> in your browser. If you see the Laravel welcome page, your installation is successful.</p>

<h2 id="configuring-environment">Configuring Environment</h2>

<p>Laravel uses an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.env</code> file for environment configuration. Copy the example file:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cp</span> .env.example .env
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then generate an application key:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>php artisan key:generate
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="database-configuration">Database Configuration</h2>

<p>Update your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.env</code> file with database details:</p>

<div class="language-ini highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="py">DB_CONNECTION</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="s">mysql</span>
<span class="py">DB_HOST</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="s">127.0.0.1</span>
<span class="py">DB_PORT</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="s">3306</span>
<span class="py">DB_DATABASE</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="s">laravel</span>
<span class="py">DB_USERNAME</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="s">root</span>
<span class="py">DB_PASSWORD</span><span class="p">=</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Run migrations to set up the database:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>php artisan migrate
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="running-your-laravel-application">Running Your Laravel Application</h2>

<p>Use the built-in PHP server:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>php artisan serve
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or configure a virtual host in Apache/Nginx for better performance.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>You have successfully installed Laravel! Explore the framework and build amazing applications.</p>

<p>How about a yummy crepe?</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg" alt="Crepe" /></p>

<p>It can also be centered!</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>var foo = function(x) {

<h2 id="an-exhibit-of-markdown">An exhibit of Markdown</h2>

<p><em>Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn’t automatically save itself.</em></p>

<h2 id="basic-formatting">Basic formatting</h2>

<p>Paragraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.</p>

<p>Paragraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of <em>italics</em> and <strong>bold</strong> is supported. This <em>can be <strong>nested</strong> like</em> so.</p>

<h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>

<h3 id="ordered-list">Ordered list</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>A second item</li>
  <li>Number 3</li>
  <li>Ⅳ</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for <a href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm">Roman numeral four</a>.</em></p>

<h3 id="unordered-list">Unordered list</h3>

<ul>
  <li>An item</li>
  <li>Another item</li>
  <li>Yet another item</li>
  <li>And there’s more…</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="paragraph-modifiers">Paragraph modifiers</h2>

<h3 id="code-block">Code block</h3>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inline code</code> to add code into other things.</p>

<h3 id="quote">Quote</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="headings">Headings</h2>

<p>There are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You’ve probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.</p>

<h3 id="headings-can-also-contain-formatting">Headings <em>can</em> also contain <strong>formatting</strong></h3>

<h3 id="they-can-even-contain-inline-code">They can even contain <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inline code</code></h3>

<p>Of course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.</p>

<p>I don’t recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you’re smallest heading isn’t too small, and you’re largest heading isn’t too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.</p>

<h2 id="urls">URLs</h2>

<p>URLs can be made in a handful of ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A named link to <a href="https://www.markitdown.net/">MarkItDown</a>. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+L</code>.</li>
  <li>Another named link to <a href="https://www.markitdown.net/">MarkItDown</a></li>
  <li>Sometimes you just want a URL like <a href="https://www.markitdown.net/">https://www.markitdown.net/</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="horizontal-rule">Horizontal rule</h2>

<p>A horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.</p>

<hr />

<p>It’s sometimes handy for breaking things up.</p>

<h2 id="images">Images</h2>

<p>Markdown can also contain images. I’ll need to add something here sometime.</p>

<h2 id="finally">Finally</h2>

<p>There’s actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">introduction</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">syntax</a> for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.</p>]]></content><author><name>Samir Wadiwala</name></author><category term="markdown" /><category term="example" /><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This note demonstrates some of what Markdown is capable of doing.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mathjax Test</title><link href="/articles/markdown/2018/05/26/mathjax-test.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mathjax Test" /><published>2018-05-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-05-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/articles/markdown/2018/05/26/mathjax-test</id><content type="html" xml:base="/articles/markdown/2018/05/26/mathjax-test.html"><![CDATA[<ul>

<p>Some of you know that we occasionally play for weddings. As you can imagine, we get a LOT of requests for Canon in D, and we discovered that there were no good arrangements available anywhere for piano and cello! Hard to believe given its popularity. So we decided to make our own! We tried to stick as closely to the original as possible (which was written for three violins and basso continuo), and we performed it <em>not</em> at a snail’s pace so the bride can actually make it down the aisle without putting everyone to sleep. 🙊(Yeah, we said it! Nobody likes a slow processional!) Also, the number one complaint about this piece from cellists is always how booooring it is to play because they literally have to play the same 8 bass notes over and over for the entire piece. Problem solved with this arrangement because the cello never has to play the bass! 🙌(The piano does, but we get lots of other fun stuff too so it’s ok!) So for all you musicians out there playing weddings, we hope you enjoy playing this arrangement a little more than the ones you were used to…You can get it from www.musicnotes.com. 😊Be sure to let us know in the comments if you do!</p>
